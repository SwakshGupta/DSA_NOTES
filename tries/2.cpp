Mark as Completed

43


Problem Statement: Implement a Trie data structure that supports the following methods:

Insert (word): To insert a string `word` in the Trie.
Count Words Equal To (word): Return the count of occurrences of the string word in the Trie.
Count Words Starting With (prefix): Return the count of words in the Trie that have the string “prefix” as a prefix.
Erase (word): Delete one occurrence of the string word from the Trie.
Note:

The Erase(word) function is guaranteed to be called only when a word is present in the Trie.
Release the memory associated with variables using dynamic memory allocation at the end of your solution.
