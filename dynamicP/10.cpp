/*
494. Target Sum

You are given an integer array nums and an integer target.

You want to build an expression out of nums by adding one of the symbols '+' and '-' before each integer in nums and then concatenate all the integers.

For example, if nums = [2, 1], you can add a '+' before 2 and a '-' before 1 and concatenate them to build the expression "+2-1".



We will just divide this thing into two subsets and then check the difference of both the subsets equal to the target

code same as 9.cpp watch lecture for more clearity
